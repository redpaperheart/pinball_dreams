# pinballdreams
More details to follow

Arduino -> reading Hall effect sensors, one reflective IR sensor, and photocells to tell what pinball events have happened

Cinder -> communicating with Arduino through Serial, mapping the location of the pinball events onto the machine (projection) and illuminating when they are hit
